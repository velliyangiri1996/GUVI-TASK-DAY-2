    <h3 style = "color:blue;">Window Screen</h3>
    <p>The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.<br>

        All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.<br>
        
        Global variables are properties of the window object.<br>
        
        Global functions are methods of the window object.</p>
    
    <p>Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions .<br> 
        It can be used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc.<br>
       It is not mandatory to write window prefix with screen object. It can be written without window prefix</p>
    
    <h3 style="color:blue;">Window Document</h3>
    <p>The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content which is the DOM tree. <br>
        When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser  it becomes a document object</p>

    <p>
        The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.<br>
         HTML documents, served with the "text/html" content type, also implement the HTMLDocument interface
